# covid19-va-md-dc
consolidated spreadsheet of tallies for DC, MD, and VA

disclaimer - I try to update the data daily with automation as much as possible, so the numbers could be inaccurate.  Each jurisdiction updates their data as frequently as possible, so I pull the data at the end of the day (2100 ET).  As a result, I've included the data sources, just in case.

05 April: 
* started including MD negative test (-) results as part of daily tally.  Daily positive/confirmed tests (+) divided by total daily tests, can be an indicator of spread.  Limiting factor is the number of tests available.
* also started counting daily hospitalization and mortality rates.  These factors are most likely affected by age distribution of afflicted population.
