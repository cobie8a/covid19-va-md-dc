consolidated spreadsheet of tallies for DC, MD, and VA

disclaimer - I try to update the data daily with automation as much as possible, so the numbers could be inaccurate.  Each jurisdiction updates their data as frequently as possible, so I pull the data at the end of the day (2100 ET).  As a result, I've included the data sources, just in case.

Observations, possible indicators, others:
* Daily deltas (of confirmed cases) - each jurisdiction varies. Although it can be thought of as an indicator, there are many unknown factors per jurisdiction which affects those daily numbers (ie - population/density).
* Daily deceased tally - can also be thought of as indicators, but again, that is affected by a diverse set of factors (ie - age distribution of the population per jurisdiction, availability of care - again affected by population density, etc)
* Daily hospitalization tally - could also be used as an indicator at an abstract level, though it may be highly correlated to the age distribution of the population.  Not all jurisdictions provide hospitalization data.
